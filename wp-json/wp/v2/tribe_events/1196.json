There are many things you can have and do at our club. You can practice different levels of game. So what is golf Golf is a ball sport with a centuries-old tradition. The aim is to play a ball into a hole with as few strokes as possible, using different golf clubs. A round of golf usually consists of 9 to 18 holes that are completed one after the other on a golf course. If the ball cannot be played properly (for example because it can no longer be found or has sunk in a pond), the rules of golf provide for certain possibilities of resumption, but mostly with the addition of penalties.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Dicta sunt explicabo.
