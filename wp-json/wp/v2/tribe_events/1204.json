This value represents the number of strokes that a very good player (a scratch golfer with a handicap of 0) takes on average to get the ball off the tee and into the hole. When calculating par for a fairway, it is always assumed that two putts will be executed on the green. Then there is a certain number of strokes for the game from the tee to the green. This number varies with the length of the hole, not with its difficulty, which is also given by bunkers, hills, water, etc. and is given separately as a course and slope rating.<\/p>\n<p>According to the current golf rules, the player can take up to 14 clubs on a round of golf. The clubs differ in the length of the shaft (measured in inches for golf), loft, design and material. Basically, the trajectory of the ball is controlled by the loft and the shaft length: the more loft, the higher and shorter the trajectory; the longer the club, the more it can be accelerated and the further the ball flies. The woods are used for the tee-off and long strokes (area from 180 m) on the fairway. They are the longest clubs and have the largest club head, which is hollow and, despite its name, is no longer made of wood. Most players have a wood 1 (also called a driver) in their bag and one to three other woods for shorter distances (wood 3, 5, 7).<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Dicta sunt explicabo.
